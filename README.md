**Hi, I'm Chidi Pascal ðŸ‘‹**

Experience software engineer with background on mobile development. Spent the last 4 years in the payment, logistics and ticketing industry. 
My core strenth lies in my understanding of engineering principles, leadership and collaboration. This has helped me to work with cross functional teams
and deliver results that impact business goals. At a former role, i helped a logistics company grow their app trust by moving the app rating from 3.6 star rating 
to 4.6. Over the past 8 months, i've been busy mentoring developers and helping them gain the understanding they need to build enterprise applications. 

Feel free to reachout for speaking or mentorship engagement.
